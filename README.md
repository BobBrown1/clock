# School Clock

This is a simple yet helpful web app made for storing your class schedules with no database needed. You can view a the official website for this repository [here](https://whenislun.ch).

## How it works:

Once you enter your school schedule into the site and submit, you'll receive an alert that the submitting process was a success and your schedule, including your current class and the time left,  will appear in the upper half of the page.
If you are not alerted, there is a formatting error in your schedule, as the red box above the text boxes will say. 

You can reload, close the tab and reopen it, close the window, even have two of the same tabs open at once, and it will remember your schedule without you needing to re-enter it or mess around with the paramaters.
If you want to change your schedule, you can simply enter in a new schedule and click submit once again - your schedule will update accordingly. And if you really want the website to forget your schedule, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and click the `Remove Stored Schedule` button. If that
somehow doesn't work, then just open your browser settings and clear your history/cache. 

## Fun Features:
* Dark Mode
  - This is just a fun feature for those who can't tolerate light mode. It can be turned on/off with the button labeled `Dark Mode` at the bottom of the page.
* Share Schedule
  - This is an amazing feature for anyone who doesn't have the same schedule every day. Nobody wants to have to re-enter their schedule differently every day, right?
  - With the Share Schedule feature, every time you enter your schedule for the first time, you can click on the `Share Schedule` button (also at the bottom of the page), and you will be given a long-ish URL that will automatically load the current schedule when you open the link.
    + You can also text/email this link to your friends who may have the same schedule as you so they can get their schedules auto-set.
  - You can copy and paste the URL into a new tab and click `OK` when it asks you if you'd like to remain on the page. This will allow you to bookmark the long link. Now you can save a bookmark for each day's schedule and click whichever one depending on the day! Amazing!
    + Funny, you can also use one of my other creations, [LinksForMe](https://linksfor.me), to create a link group of your schedule!
